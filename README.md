# Lung-Vessel-Segmentation-Using-Graph-cuts

1. Prepare the Graph-cuts optimizer with the following link: 
http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bagon/matlab_code/GCmex1.9.tar.gz

2. Unzip the 'GCmex1.9.tar.gz' and complie the graph-cuts mex file following the corresponding instruction.

3. Run Demo.m file in Matlab

If you use the software, you should reference the following paper:
